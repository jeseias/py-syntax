# Learning Pyhton

I believe this small project contains all basic principle to learn __python syntax__
And __programming logic__ in general.

## App Requirements

1. User should _(for as long as he wants)_ insert a series of ninjas with their names and respective __belt colours__.

2. Shoudn't allow ninjas to have the same name

3. Prompt user with a basic review of ninjas added.
> Eg: if user insertsthe following ninjas "Cabitango, Amadeu, Kiabala" all with the same color belt __red__. The user should recieve "Cabitango, Amadeu and Kiabala are red belts". If only one ninja was added: "Cabitango is a red belt"

4. The console app should number each group of belts
> Eg: The are 3 red belts or They is 1 black belt
